I am a first-year Ph.D. student from the [FRVP Lab](https://frvp.njit.edu/index.html) in the department of computer science at New Jersey Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Chengjun Liu](https://web.njit.edu/~cliu/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in information & computing science from the department of mathematics at South China University of Technology. 

Research Interest
------
Machine learning, particularly statistical learning and its application in medical image processing and computer-aided diagnosis.
